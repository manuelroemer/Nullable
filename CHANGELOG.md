# Changelog

# v1.4.0

Nullable feature is now automatically enabled by default.

* For legacy frameworks (before NetCoreApp3.0/NetStandard2.1) warnings won't be raised:
`<Nullable>Annotation</Nullable>`
* While full activation is done only for recent frameworks (NetCoreApp3.0/NetStandard2.1 or more recent):
`<Nullable>Enable</Nullable>`
* And in all cases C# version is defined to use last version: `<LangVersion>Latest</LangVersion>`

This are default values that are used if you do not override them in your csproj file.
They have been chosen to match the most common use case which is multi-targeted projects that target recent frameworks that will produce the warnings and legacy frameworks that will just be annotated ignoring warnings related to the fact that the frameworks are not annotated. 

# v1.3.0

This release adds support for .NET 5's `MemberNotNullAttribute` and `MemberNotNullWhenAttribute`.


# v1.2.1

This release fixes the XML documentation from the nullable attributes leaking into the automatically
generated XML documentation file of consumers of the package (see [issue #8](https://github.com/manuelroemer/Nullable/issues/8)).

**Details:**

For now, the attribute's XML documentation is wrapped in `#if DEBUG` conditionals. This ensures that
the attribute's XML documentation doesn't appear in the documentation file of a release build while
still being available during development (e.g. for IntelliSense in Visual Studio).


# v1.2.0

This release provides solutions for [issue #1](https://github.com/manuelroemer/Nullable/issues/1) and
[issue #6](https://github.com/manuelroemer/Nullable/issues/6). In addition, potential compiler
warnings in the `NullableAttributes.cs` file are now hidden.

**Upgrading:**

Remove any previously defined `NULLABLE_ATTRIBUTES_EXCLUDE_FROM_CODE_COVERAGE` compiler constant,
as it does not have any effect anymore.

> :information_source: **Note:** <br/>
> Builds will NOT break if the constant is still defined. It is simply ignored now.

**Details:**

* The package now supports `packages.config` via a `content/` folder in the NuGet package.
* The attributes are now excluded from code coverage by default.
  When referenced from projects targeting .NET Standard >= 2.0 or .NET Framework >= 4.0, the
  `ExcludeFromCodeCoverageAttribute` is used. For other project types, the `DebuggerNonUserCodeAttribute`
  is used.
* Added support for the `NULLABLE_ATTRIBUTES_INCLUDE_IN_CODE_COVERAGE` compiler constant which
  removes the code coverage attributes.
* The `NULLABLE_ATTRIBUTES_EXCLUDE_FROM_CODE_COVERAGE` compiler constant no longer has
  any effects. Code coverage is now disabled by default.
* The `NullableAttributes.cs` file now wraps the attributes with a `#pragma warning disable` and
  `#pragma warning restore` block to disable both compiler- and code-analysis warnings.


# v1.1.1

This release adds the `// <auto-generated>` header to the `NullableAttributes.cs` file so that
code analyzers like StyleCop ignore the file during the static code analysis.
Thanks to [@skarllot](https://github.com/skarllot) for suggesting and making this change!


# v1.1.0

This release updates the package, so that the attributes file is no longer included in projects
targeting a framework >= .NET Standard 2.1.
For any target version below, the file is still automatically included.
This ensures that the package can easily be installed in libraries which are multi-targeting
different frameworks, without them having to define conditional compilation constants.

In addition, a small typo in the XML documentation was fixed.


# v1.0.0

The initial release.

This release covers the following attributes:

* `AllowNullAttribute`
* `DisallowNullAttribute`
* `DoesNotReturnAttribute`
* `DoesNotReturnIfAttribute`
* `MaybeNullAttribute`
* `MaybeNullWhenAttribute`
* `NotNullAttribute`
* `NotNullIfNotNullAttribute`
* `NotNullWhenAttribute`

Furthermore, the following compiler directives are supported in the source file:

* `NULLABLE_ATTRIBUTES_DISABLE`
* `NULLABLE_ATTRIBUTES_EXCLUDE_FROM_CODE_COVERAGE`
